# University Project
Here is a bunch of project realized at Sorbonne University 

<h2>Second year of bachelor degree </h2>
Automata Project <p> Discrete mathematics - Python -  Modelisation of automata : deterministic, finite . . . </p>
Blockchain <p> We were working on a blockchain concensus(Bitcoin consensus), to create an electronic vote system in C. We used different data structures such as Binary Tree, double linked list, hash table... We compare their complexity and their performance for the data used in this project.</p>

<h2>Third year </h2>
<p>Comming soon</p>
